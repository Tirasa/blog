            So why don't take a look at mailing list archives? Rob Weir did it recently for Apache OpenOffice and this was of inspiration for applying the same approach to Apache Syncope, using some good old shell scripting and Wordle app. Let's take a look at the results.</description></item><item><title>Apache Syncope 1.1.5 (Ad libitum) released</title><link>http://blog.tirasa.net/apache-syncope-1-1-5.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2013 16:57:00 +0100</pubDate><description>The Apache Syncope team is pleased to announce the release of Syncope 1.1.5 (Ad libitum).

Such approachs, however, are often quite invasive and hardly customizable. Many providers - like as Apache CXF - are able to dynamically generate a WADL representation out of JAX-RS annotated classes: such XML representation can be easily put into an XSLT transformation in order to obtain some end-user REST documentation.</description></item><item><title>Apache Syncope 1.1.4 (Ad libitum) released</title><link>http://blog.tirasa.net/apache-syncope-1-1-4.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2013 10:01:00 +0200</pubDate><description>The Apache Syncope team is proud to announce the availability of the new maintenance release of Ad libitum.

            Well, despite of the fact that the former reached its widest spread when the the latter's major version was 3, 4 or 5 at most, it is actually possible.

            Hence, one more time, I come to Eclipse website, spend some nice time finding the right version for me, then download, uncompress, start.

Wrong, at least if you need some Spring goodies like @Autowired and @Transactional.</description></item><item><title>Getting started with Activiti (and Maven)</title><link>http://blog.tirasa.net/getting-started-with-activiti-and.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2011 00:51:00 +0200</pubDate><description>Syncope needs a new workflow engine, for many good reasons: here's why I've started playing around with Activiti.

            Activiti looks really interesting because of features and Apache 2.0 license; moreover, its spicy story makes it even more attractive.</description></item><item><title>Cocoon 3 and Hippo CMS at work</title><link>http://blog.tirasa.net/cocoon-3-and-hippo-cms.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jul 2011 15:43:00 +0200</pubDate><description>I recently presented some aspects of the renewed Apache Cocoon power through its latest (and not yet completed) release, 3.0.

            To be honest, the latest release is slowly approaching to a stable level, especially if compared to the wide spread and appreciation that 2.x series used to have - and still has, to a certain extent - all around the world.</description></item><item><title>HSQLDB 2.0.0, BLOB &amp;amp; Hibernate</title><link>http://blog.tirasa.net/hsqldb-2-0-0-blob.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2011 15:56:00 +0200</pubDate><description>HSQLDB is a very nice and complete all-Java DBMS, particularly useful when doing quick test-outs or maven tests.
